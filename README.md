# ChefKart (Assignment)
I have created a clone of the ChefKart website as part of my assignment. I utilized React.js, a popular JavaScript framework, for the development. For styling, I employed Tailwind CSS, a CSS framework known for its utility-first approach. Additionally, I incorporated React Router Dom and React Icons for dynamic routing and Data Loading within the application.
